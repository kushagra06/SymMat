# SymMat
A C++ class to store symmetric matrices (3x3) from Eigen::Matrix (3x3) in a linear array. Also, functions for matrix addition and multiplication are included.

To compile the code just run g++ sym_mat.cpp, if there's a symlink created or if the Eigen folder is in /usr/local/include. Otherwise include Eigen's source code in the path.
